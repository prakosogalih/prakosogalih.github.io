Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has proven ROI in diverse industries. Understanding common use cases helps teams identify opportunities in their own organizations.

High-impact RPA use cases:

**Finance & Accounting**
- Invoice processing and data entry from PDFs into ERP systems.
- Reconciliation of bank statements and general ledger accounts.
- Expense report processing and approval workflows.
- Monthly/quarterly financial closing tasks.

**HR & Payroll**
- Employee onboarding workflows (system provisioning, document collection).
- Leave and attendance tracking across multiple systems.
- Payroll data validation and error correction.

**Customer Service**
- Ticket classification and routing to appropriate teams.
- Customer data enrichment from multiple sources.
- Automated response generation for common inquiries.

**Supply Chain & Logistics**
- Purchase order creation from requests.
- Shipment tracking and status updates.
- Inventory reconciliation across warehouses.

**Typical ROI metrics:**
- 30-50% reduction in processing time per transaction.
- 80-90% fewer manual errors.
- Payback period: 6-12 months (depending on volume and complexity).

Success factors:
1. High-volume, repetitive, rule-based processes.
2. Stable, structured input data.
3. Multiple system integrations (not single-system automation).
4. Clear metrics to measure before/after.

Start with processes that have high transaction volume and minimal exception handling to maximize early wins.
