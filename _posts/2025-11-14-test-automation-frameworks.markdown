Selecting the right test automation framework can make or break your automation strategy. The choice depends on your tech stack, team expertise, and testing scope.

Popular frameworks by use case:

- **Selenium**: Web automation, mature ecosystem, multi-language support.
- **Cypress**: Modern web testing, excellent developer experience, fast feedback loops.
- **Appium**: Cross-platform mobile automation (iOS, Android).
- **Jest/Vitest**: Unit and integration testing for JavaScript/Node.js.
- **PyTest**: Python-based testing, ideal for data-driven automation.

Evaluation criteria:

1. Language alignment with your codebase.
2. Community size and support availability.
3. Maintenance burden and learning curve.
4. Integration with CI/CD pipelines.
5. Cost (open-source vs. commercial licenses).

Start with a proof-of-concept (POC) on a small test suite to evaluate the framework's fit before committing to large-scale adoption.
