**GX Works3 and GX Works2 software are alternative versions of Mitsubishi Developer PLC programmable PLC Mitsubishi FX1N, FX2N FX3G, FX3U FX5U, PLC PLC cpu, Q cpu … Generally all Mitsubishi PLC series. I also recommend using GX Works instead of GX Developer, programming much faster. GX Works has a built-in simulation so you don’t need to install the Simulation version like GX Developer anymore.**
